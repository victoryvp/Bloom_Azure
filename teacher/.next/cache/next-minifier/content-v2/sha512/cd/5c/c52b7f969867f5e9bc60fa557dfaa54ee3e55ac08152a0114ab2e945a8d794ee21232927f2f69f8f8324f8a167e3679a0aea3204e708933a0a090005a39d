Thermal energy is caused by tiny particles in materials moving, measured by its temperature. Heat is the transfer of thermal energy from hotter to colder materials. Heat is used for warming ourselves, houses, cooking food, etc. Heat can be produced, for example, by the Sun, fire, friction, or from chemical reactions, such as the warmth created by activating a packaged heat wrap.\")),t(\"div\",{className:\"popupimg\"},t(\"img\",{src:\"../../assets/images/popupimg/energy.png\"})))),t(\"div\",{className:\"card lessoncard\"},t(\"div\",{className:\"card-header\"},t(\"h5\",null,\"Key Concept 2: We can observe and differentiate forms of energy.\")),t(\"div\",{className:\"card-block\"},t(\"div\",{className:\"popuptxt\"},t(\"p\",null,\"Students can compare and contrast the various forms of energy. Several similarities exist, in that all energy forms have the following in common: 1) the ability to cause change or do work, 2) the dependence that all living things have on energy in order to survive, and 3) the large number of devices humans have invented that use each form of energy. However, forms of energy do vary in their source and their function. Different forms of energy occur naturally, such as the light and heat that come from the Sun or from a fire (heat energy) started by lightning; or flowing water and animals that make sound (sound energy) and move (mechanical energy). Other forms of energy are human-made, such as a toaster (heat energy), radio (sound energy), light bulb (light energy), a car (mechanical energy), or an extension cord (electrical energy). The biggest difference among forms of energy occurs in the infinite number of ways humans use both natural forms of energy and man-made energy devices to live, work, and play on this planet.\")),t(\"div\",{className:\"popupimg\"},t(\"img\",{src:\"../../assets/images/popupimg/keyconcept2.png\"})))),t(\"div\",{className:\"card lessoncard\"},t(\"div\",{className:\"card-header\"},t(\"h5\",null,\"Key Concept 3: Light bulbs, toasters, fans, and televisions are common, everyday objects that produce or use light, heat, mechanical, sound, and electrical energy.\")),t(\"div\",{className:\"card-block\"},t(\"div\",{className:\"popuptxt\"},t(\"p\",null,\"To help students sort through everyday objects and to match those objects with their form of energy, alert them to the possibility that some objects can transfer or convert one energy source to one or more forms of energy.\"),t(\"p\",null,\"For example, all devices that are plugged into a socket with a cord or use a battery are powered by electrical energy, yet the object may convert that electrical energy into a number of other energy forms, such as a light bulb (light and heat energy), radio (sound energy), television (sound and light energy), pop-up toaster (heat and mechanical energy), or fan (mechanical energy).\")),t(\"div\",{className:\"popupimg\"},t(\"img\",{src:\"../../assets/images/popupimg/keyconcept3.png\"})))))}},wZdj:function(e,n,a){\"use strict\";a.r(n);var l=a(\"q1tI\"),t=a.n(l).a.createElement;n.default=function(){return t(\"div\",{style:{textAlign:\"middle\"}},t(\"div\",{className:\"card lessoncard\"},t(\"div\",{className:\"card-header\"},t(\"h5\",null,\"Section: Essentials\")),t(\"div\",{className:\"card-block\"},t(\"div\",{className:\"popuptxt\"},t(\"h5\",null,\"Pre-Assessment\"),t(\"br\",null),t(\"h6\",null,\"Question 1\"),t(\"p\",null,\"B\"),t(\"h6\",null,\"Question 2\"),t(\"p\",null,\"D\"),t(\"h6\",null,\"Question 3\"),t(\"p\",null,\"B\"),t(\"h6\",null,\"Question 4\"),t(\"p\",null,\"C\"),t(\"h6\",null,\"Question 5\"),t(\"p\",null,\"A\")))),t(\"div\",{className:\"card lessoncard\"},t(\"div\",{className:\"card-header\"},t(\"h5\",null,\"Section: Engage\")),t(\"div\",{className:\"card-block\"},t(\"div\",{className:\"popuptxt\"},t(\"h5\",null,\"Engage Teacher Instructions\"),t(\"p\",null,\"See this component for additional facilitation.\")))),t(\"div\",{className:\"card lessoncard\"},t(\"div\",{className:\"card-header\"},t(\"h5\",null,\"Section: Explore\")),t(\"div\",{className:\"card-block\"},t(\"div\",{className:\"popuptxt\"},t(\"h5\",null,\"Explore Teacher Guide\"),t(\"p\",null,\"See this component for Sample Student Answers in the Student Journal.\")))),t(\"div\",{className:\"card lessoncard\"},t(\"div\",{className:\"card-header\"},t(\"h5\",null,\"Explore Student Materials\")),t(\"div\",{className:\"card-block\"},t(\"div\",{className:\"popuptxt\"},t(\"p\",null,\"Item from Box 1 Form(s) of Energy Observed\"),t(\"div\",{className:\"table-responsive\"},t(\"table\",{className:\"table table-bordered\"},t(\"thead\",null),t(\"tbody\",null,t(\"tr\",null,t(\"td\",null,\"Hand Warmer\"),t(\"td\",null,\"Thermal\")),t(\"tr\",null,t(\"td\",null,\"Battery\"),t(\"td\",null,\"Electrical\")),t(\"tr\",null,t(\"td\",null,\"Ruler\"),t(\"td\",null,\"Sound\")),t(\"tr\",null,t(\"td\",null,\"Glow Stick\"),t(\"td\",null,\"Light\")),t(\"tr\",null,t(\"td\",null,\"UV Beads\"),t(\"td\",null,\"Light\")),t(\"tr\",null,t(\"td\",null,\"Pop Rock Candy\"),t(\"td\",null,\"Sound\")),t(\"tr\",null,t(\"td\",null,\"Scissors\"),t(\"td\",null,\"Mechanical\"))))),t(\"br\",null),t(\"h6\",null,\"Question 1\"),t(\"p\",null,\"Each item produced one form of energy.\"),t(\"h6\",null,\"Question 2\"),t(\"p\",null,\"Through observation I can tell what form of energy is being produced.
