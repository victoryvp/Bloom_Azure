For example, if the students chose a lamp. they would prepare: an image of a lamp with a light bulb; the socket it plugs into; the electric lines that carry electricity to the house; the power company that burns coal to make steam that turns a turbine to produce the electricity, the ancient plants that became the coal; and finally an image of the Sun whose sunlight was captured by the plants. The students glue on tiny Velcro pieces to the back of the images and they place them out of order on Velcro pieces on the stick. On the back side is a glued strip with the correct order.
