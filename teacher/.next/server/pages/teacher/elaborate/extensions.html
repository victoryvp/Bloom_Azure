Then convert it to a turbine by re-pinning it to the end of the eraser, taping a 30 cm length of string with a small weight (load) at the end to the pencil shaft and sliding the shaft into a holder made from a piece of large diameter drinking straw. When the pinwheel shaft (pencil) rotates within the straw holder, it winds up the string and lifts the load.</p></div></div></div><div class="card lessoncard"><div class="card-header"><h5>Energy Ball Toss Game</h5></div><div class="card-block"><div class="popuptxt"><p>Forms of energy can come from natural sources like the mechanical power of a tsunami wave toppling over buildings, or the power of lightning to start a fire. Other forms of energy are man-made such as a toaster that heats bread. For this game you will need a beach ball that has yarn taped down around the middle of the ball. On one half of the ball tape a card with the letter M for man-made. On the other half tape a card with the letter N for natural. The class stands in a large circle. The teacher begins by tossing the ball to a student. Where ever the student’s right thumb lands is the category for which the student must give an example not yet been mentioned. If the answer is wrong or not given, the student steps out of the circle and observes. Continue play until 5 students remain as winners. One variation is to announce this game well ahead of time so students can prepare possible answers for man-made and natural energy sources.</p></div></div></div><div class="card lessoncard"><div class="card-header"><h5>Reverse Order Stick Sort</h5></div><div class="card-block"><div class="popuptxt"><p>Each student needs a paint wood stirrer stick, small Velcro strips, paper, scissors, and a glue stick. Student partners draw or cut out images showing the transfer of energy from the Sun to the final use of energy. Each partner groups needs to research the flow of energy from its final use reverse back to where the energy began with the Sun. For example, if the students chose a lamp. they would prepare: an image of a lamp with a light bulb; the socket it plugs into; the electric lines that carry electricity to the house; the power company that burns coal to make steam that turns a turbine to produce the electricity, the ancient plants that became the coal; and finally an image of the Sun whose sunlight was captured by the plants. The students glue on tiny Velcro pieces to the back of the images and they place them out of order on Velcro pieces on the stick. On the back side is a glued strip with the correct order. Partners exchange energy sticks on their team and try to put them in the right order. Then teams exchange sticks and try to put those in order.</p></div></div></div><div class="card lessoncard"><div class="card-header"><h5>Mystery Energy Product</h5></div><div class="card-block"><div class="popuptxt"><p>Students play this game by thinking of an object or event that uses energy in a particular way and give one a short clue worth the most points. where other students have to guess. The second clue for less points, and so one. For example, the student can say:</p><p>1) “ I am small, I use electrical and magnetic energy. I like being connected to a computer. I store computer information.” (jump drive or memory stick).</p><p>2) “I am very big, I have tons of water flowing through me. I produce electrical energy.” ( hydroelectric dam).</p><p>3)“ I am very big, I have water that makes me move. I produce mechanical energy.” (water wheel mill). “</p><p>4) ” I am metal and turn. I use electrical energy to make mechanical energy. I make people cool.“ (A fan)</p></div></div></div><div class="card lessoncard"><div class="card-header"><h5>Inventors Night</h5></div><div class="card-block"><div class="popuptxt"><p>Hold a parent night where students or partners research an inventor of an energy product, make a poster of their results, and present their findings to parents and students. Some examples are Thomas Edison (phonograph or light bulb), Mary Anderson (windshield wipers), Alexander Bell (telephone), Eli Whitney (Cotton Gin), Johannes Gutenberg (printing press), Ben Franklin (Ben Franklin iron stove, bifocal glasses), Henry Ford (car), etc.</p></div></div></div><div class="card lessoncard"><div class="card-header"><h5>Kinesthetic</h5></div><div class="card-block"><div class="popuptxt"><p>Divide students into groups and give directions to create common sounds using recyclable materials. Some common sounds could be thunder, creaky door, wind, rain, animal sounds, etc. Have groups demonstrate their sounds to the class. Discuss the different materials used to create similar sounds.</p></div></div></div></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{}},"page":"/teacher/elaborate/extensions","query":{},"buildId":"7dhTg-Hdx9XVki-cO5_pm","nextExport":true,"autoExport":true,"isFallback":false}</script><script nomodule="" src="/_next/static/chunks/polyfills-39266febbcf4b60e8eda.js"></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/main-b1e3f393a63dc93c9583.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/webpack-ccf5ab034a524403276a.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/framework.0af185ce84f114f60bdc.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/924baa5d.ba36a6d9659dca84917c.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/8cf7bdd1.e1207dad283b19083db8.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/9c5782a4bb0edbc3b59aaffcd28fc88c6ffd409a.39399dcf35cac9b841ad.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/4ee640b898ef19923646dd473122f9f30940fe10.0d61c23732a878f84eaa.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/pages/_app-bfd57e89cf890aa38734.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/pages/teacher/elaborate/extensions-30128d546fb472b03b70.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/7dhTg-Hdx9XVki-cO5_pm/_buildManifest.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/7dhTg-Hdx9XVki-cO5_pm/_ssgManifest.js" async=""></script></body></html>
