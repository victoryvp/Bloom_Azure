If using Go!Temp instead of a thermometer, hang the probe from the ring stand so that it is in the beaker of water but not touching the bottoms or sides.)</li><li>Open the LoggerLite software and set the data collection time for 750 seconds.</li><li>Duplicate the data collection table for each student. Cut apart.</li><li>Wash and remove the labels from an empty water bottle for each group.</li><li>Duplicate a copy of the design portfolio and the group rubric for each group.</li><li>Use an electric kettle, microwave, or hot plate to heat some water for the exploration part of the activity. Do not get the water too hot. It will cause the plastic water bottle to deform.</li><li>Prepare some ice water for each group.</li></ol></div></div></div><div class="card lessoncard"><div class="card-header"><h5>Procedure and Facilitation Points</h5></div><div class="card-block"><div class="popuptxt"><h6>1) Introduce the challenge and define the problem.</h6><ul><li>Give each student a sticky note and a marker.</li><li>Ask the students to think about how hot they can heat water given the proper equipment and an unlimited amount of time.</li><li>Have the students use the marker on the sticky note to write down their prediction for the hottest temperature they can get the water.</li><li>Call on a student to bring forward his/her sticky note and place it on the board or a piece of chart paper. Create a classroom graph on the board or chart paper by having the other students come forward and place their notes relative to the first note.</li><li>Discuss their ideas. Tell the students that they are going to collect data as water is heated. They will then analyze the data to see if their predictions about how hot they can get the water are accurate.</li><li>Call on a volunteer to measure 150 mL of distilled water in the glass beaker. You do not have to use distilled water; however, you are more likely to get a boiling point of exactly 100C (tap water has some impurities which will make it boil slightly below or above 100C). Ask students what must be done to the water to make it boil.</li><li>Put the beaker on the hot plate. Make sure the temperature probe is in the water but not touching the bottom or sides of the beaker.</li><li>Have students record the initial temperature on the data collection table (in the 0 seconds column).</li><li>Turn on the hot plate to a medium-high temperature. Click the Collect button on the LoggerLite software.</li><li>Have students record the temperature every 30 seconds as the water heats and boils. NOTE: The data collection table will not be completely filled in. Stop the test when the temperature remains constant for 2-3 minutes. Discuss the results of the demonstration (the water temperature will most likely reach between 99.7C and 100.4C and remain there). If the boiling point is not exactly 100C, point out that there may be some impurities in the water that raise or lower its boiling point. 100C is the boiling point of PURE water.</li><li>Have a student observe the water to find out how much water is left in the beaker. It should be less than 150 mL due to some evaporation that occurred as it was heated.</li></ul><p><b>Ask the following questions:</b></p><ol><li>What was the hottest temperature that the water reached as it was heated?</li><li>Do you think heating it longer would make it get hotter? Explain your answer.</li><li>How much water was in the beaker before it was heated?</li><li>How much water was left in the beaker after it was heated?<ul><li>Why is there less water now than at the beginning of the demonstration? Make sure students understand that the water does not get hotter than 100oC, but it begins to evaporate after reaching that temperature. Discuss further, as desired.</li><li>Remind students that engineers design for a purpose to solve a particular problem or challenge. Engineers often use temperature as an indicator of how well a system is operating. Engineers really need to know how a thermometer works and how much thermal energy is present in many different situations. For example, aerospace engineers want to make sure the interior environment of the International Space Station or a spacecraft, such as the space shuttle, is comfortable for the astronauts. After the space shuttle malfunctioned during takeoff years ago, aerospace engineers found the cause of the problem through the use of temperature data from probes located throughout the shuttleâ€™s wing that was hit by a piece of flying insulation.</li><li>Tell the students that they are going to be aerospace engineers for a day. Introduce the design challenge. Design and construct a thermometer to correctly measure the temperature of a given amount of water.</li><li>Review the following criteria with the students.</li><li>Discuss the design challenge and criteria as desired.</li></ul></li></ol><p><b>Criteria</b></p><p>The thermometer must be constructed out of the given materials.<br/>The scale developed for the thermometer must be modeled after the Celsius scale.<br/>The thermometer will be tested on warm water, room temperature water, and cold water for 3 minutes each.<br/>The thermometer will be judged effective if it correctly (+/- 3C) measures the temperatures of each water sample.</p><br/><h6>2) Research and explore the problem.</h6><ul><li>Divide the class into groups. Give each group a copy of the design portfolio. Have them write the design challenge in their own words on the portfolio.</li><li>Make sure that each group has all of the necessary materials. Guide them in completing the initial exploration.</li><li>Discuss the results of their investigation. Be sure they understand that adding or taking away thermal energy is what causes the water level in the straw to rise and fall.</li><li>Tell the students that thermometers used to be filled with mercury. However, mercury can be a very dangerous substance when released into the environment. Therefore, most thermometers today are filled with an alcohol mixture similar to the one in their thermometers.</li></ul><br/><h6>3) Brainstorm and design a solution to the problem.</h6><p>Ask the students the following questions:</p><ol><li>What was the temperature of the warm water? Why cant you tell me the exact temperature?</li><li>What was the temperature of the cold water? Why cant you tell me the exact temperature?<ul><li>Lead students to the idea that the thermometer is not really useful without a readable scale. Remind students that most scientific investigations use Celsius as the scale when determining the temperature of an object or substance.</li><li>Review the design challenge. Discuss how they might get their thermometers to give a more exact temperature reading like commercial thermometer.</li><li>Give the students time to discuss what they will do to create a scale for their thermometer.</li></ul></li></ol><br/><h6>4) Build, test, and analyze the solution.</h6><ul><li>Monitor as the students complete the creating and testing process.</li><li>Make sure they have access to warm, cold, and room temperature water.</li><li>Ask questions and redirect thinking as necessary. NOTE: This is one way to create a temperature scale on their home-made thermometers: Place their home-made thermometer in the warm water. Use a permanent marker to mark the line of the liquid in the straw. Place a commercial thermometer in the water at the same time and note the temperature. Write the temperature value on the straw. Continue with cold water. Add equal lines in between.</li></ul><br/><h6>5) Improve or redesign and retest the solution.</h6><ul><li>Give the groups time to improve their solution if necessary.</li><li>Discuss how they might improve their temperature scales.</li></ul><br/><h6>6) Present and share the results.</h6><ul><li>Allow time for each group to present their results.</li><li>Let other groups ask questions as needed.</li></ul><p>Ask the following questions if desired:</p><ol><li>What happens to the liquid in your thermometer when thermal energy is taken away?</li><li>What happens to the liquid in your thermometer when thermal energy is added?</li><li>What might happen if the thermometer is placed in a very hot liquid?</li><li>How do engineers use thermometers?<ul><li>Have the students write a reflection in their science notebooks to explain what happened when their thermometers were placed in different temperatures of water. Instruct them to use the following vocabulary words in their reflection: temperature, thermometer, thermal energy, and engineer. Also ask them to explain their thermometers scale, or units of measurement.</li></ul></li></ol><br/><p>NOTE: A logical extension to this lesson would be participating in the International Boiling Point Project (CIESE). Ever wonder what causes a pot of water to boil? If you have, this project is for you! We have people all over the world boiling water. In the past weâ€™ve had climbers on Mt. Everest, school children in La Paz, Bolivia, and college professors in Cheyenne, Wyoming all participating in the project. The purpose of this project is to discover which factor in the experiment (room temperature, elevation, volume of water, or heating device) has the greatest influence on boiling point. Anyone can participate in this yearâ€™s project. All you have to do is boil a bit of water, record a bit of information, and send it along to us to include in the database of results. Then, students can analyze all of the data to reach an answer to the question: What causes a pot of water to boil?</p><p>*For more information, conduct an internet search for &quot;The International Boiling Point Project.&quot;</p></div></div></div></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{}},"page":"/teacher/elaborate/engineering_connections","query":{},"buildId":"7dhTg-Hdx9XVki-cO5_pm","nextExport":true,"autoExport":true,"isFallback":false}</script><script nomodule="" src="/_next/static/chunks/polyfills-39266febbcf4b60e8eda.js"></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/main-b1e3f393a63dc93c9583.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/webpack-ccf5ab034a524403276a.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/framework.0af185ce84f114f60bdc.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/924baa5d.ba36a6d9659dca84917c.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/8cf7bdd1.e1207dad283b19083db8.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/9c5782a4bb0edbc3b59aaffcd28fc88c6ffd409a.39399dcf35cac9b841ad.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/4ee640b898ef19923646dd473122f9f30940fe10.0d61c23732a878f84eaa.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/pages/_app-bfd57e89cf890aa38734.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/pages/teacher/elaborate/engineering_connections-5e0355810b6bbf6c2766.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/7dhTg-Hdx9XVki-cO5_pm/_buildManifest.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/7dhTg-Hdx9XVki-cO5_pm/_ssgManifest.js" async=""></script></body></html>
