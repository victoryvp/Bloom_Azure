But if you had lived 150 years ago, you could not have done it. You would have had to use a candle or a lamp. We can thank Thomas Edison for this. In 1880, he created the light bulb. He also created how to bring electricity into homes. To make the light bulb, Edison put a filament inside a glass bulb. A filament is a thin strand inside the bulb. The strand resists, or fights against, the flow of energy. As the strand resists the flow of energy, it heats. up. Then it produces light."),a("li",null,"What about breakfast? Did you have toast? In the old days, if you wanted toast, you had to hold it over an open flame, but now we have electric toasters. We have Albert Marsh to thank. In 1905, Marsh created a special metal used to make wire. This wire quickly heats to red-hot, over and over, without breaking.  The heat cooks, or toasts, the bread inside the toaster."),a("li",null,"Did you use an electric fan to stay cool? The fan uses a motor to turn the fan blades. The blades make the breeze that keeps us cool. Michael Faraday invented the electric motor in 1821. He showed how electricity and magnetism are related. A motor uses electricity and magnets to create motion. The magnets push and pull on each other. This turns the motor. This is just like when you push the pedals on your bicycle."),a("li",null,"Did you listen to music on the way to school? Where did the sound come from? A radio? A CD player? An iPod? All of these use electricity. And they all make music in pretty much the same way. First, a microphone catches a musical sound. Next, a recorder puts the signal in an electric code. Then, a player changes the electrical code back into sound. And last, the signal is sent to a speaker. Who do we thank for this music in our lives? Once again, its Thomas Edison! He invented the phonograph in 1877. It was a machine for recording and repeating sound. Other inventors then made his invention even better. In 1909, Lee de Forest found a way to make this sound louder. And in 2001, a company called Apple invented the iPod. It is a device that can store thousands of songs, videos, and images."),a("li",null,"All of these devices and more use electricity. Electricity is needed in our everyday lives.
