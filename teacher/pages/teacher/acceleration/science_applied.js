                        <p>Most pollution can be measured and estimated by how much damage it causes to our air, water, land, and health. Even after this type of pollution has been stopped, we are still affected by it. Noise pollution, unlike other pollutions, is free from the environment once it stops. It is more of a nuisance than an environmental threat.</p>
                        <p>City governments have ordinances to control noise. This usually includes controlling sounds, like a neighbor’s barking dog, car alarms, loud music, parties, factories, and construction sites. These laws and ordinances exclude noises from jets, railroads, road traffic, and wildlife. Although we cannot control these elements of our daily life, we can make it more bearable to live with.</p>
                        <p>Sound, like light, can be absorbed and reflected. So in order to control unwanted noises, you need materials that are good absorbers of sound. When sound waves strike a material, they cause the particles in the material to vibrate. How thick and fibrous a material is will affect the absorption of sound. Music studios, radio stations, and concert halls often use materials, like foam, light or heavy carpets, and acoustic tiles, to absorb sound.</p>
