                        <p>Every year a park in your local community holds a Spring Carnival, where people come to enjoy rides, food, and music. The community uses the profits from the carnival to make improvements to the park’s landscape and jungle gym. Each ride operator, food merchant, and musician has a booth used to attract people and encourage them to stop and visit. The booths are arranged in rows to create a walkway for the crowds to follow.</p>

                        <p>The people in charge of the Spring Carnival have asked your className to create booths for some of the ride operators, food merchants, and musicians who will be at the carnival. Work with your team to decide what your booth will advertise. Your team must design a booth that will draw the crowd’s attention by using as many forms of energy as possible.</p>

                        <p>The Spring Carnival opens in the afternoon and does not close until 10:00 p.m. Make sure your booth’s design will be able to attract people’s attention at night.</p>

                        <p>Your team must design a blueprint of your booth, drawn to scale, and create a visual representation that shows what your booth will look like once it is built. You will need to label the dimensions of your booth on the blueprint and be able to discuss the materials you will use to construct your booth. You will be given time to brainstorm, plan, and design your booth. The length of your presentation will be limited to three minutes.</p>

                        <p>Divide your team into the following roles to complete the project: design team expert, architectural engineer, materials engineer, and energy expert. Develop a list of what you already know and discuss several possible designs.</p>

                        <p>Thank you for your help in creating booths for the Spring Carnival!</p>
