                                <h6>Energy</h6>
                                <p>Energy is what is needed to do work or cause change. Although there is nuclear energy (produced when atoms fuse or split and produce radiation) and chemical energy (the energy released or absorbed during chemical reactions), fourth grade students will focus only on mechanical, sound, electrical, light, and heat/thermal energy.</p>
                                <h6>Mechanical Energy</h6>
                                <p>Mechanical energy is the energy of movement or the potential for movement. Every time anything moves, whether itâ€™s a fan, wind, water, cars, engines, people, clocks, or animals running, it is mechanical energy that makes it happen. All movement is mechanical energy. Objects at rest that have the potential to move also have mechanical energy, itâ€™s just stored, like a ball sitting still at the top of a hill. Some objects vibrate when they move, producing sound energy, such as a drum or guitar strings.</p>
                                <h6>Sound Energy</h6>
                                <p>Sound energy is produced by vibrating objects. Although sound is detected by the ear, students can feel sound vibrations when they touch their throats while talking, and see sound vibrations when they put a paper plate or some candy sprinkles on top of a loud radio that causes the sprinkles to bounce around. Sound is produced in nature when animals make sounds, the oceans pound the shore, and the wind blows through the trees. Sound is also produced by vibrating objects, such as musical instruments, radios, and moving machines.</p>
                                <h6>Electrical Energy</h6>
                                <p>Electrical energy is produced by the movement of electrons. If electrons flow in a complete circuit, that energy can be used to turn on a light bulb, TV, or any electronic device.</p>
    
                                <h6>Light Energy</h6>
                                <p>Light energy can be seen by the eye and also stored for use. Light energy is produced by glowing objects, such as the Sun, a match, light bulb, or a glow stick. We use light energy to see things, illuminate dark areas, make neon signs, etc.</p>
                                <h6>Thermal Energy</h6>
                                <p>Thermal Energy is the internal kinetic energy of a material due to its molecules movements. Thermal energy is caused by tiny particles in materials moving, measured by its temperature. Heat is the transfer of thermal energy from hotter to colder materials. Heat is used for warming ourselves, houses, cooking food, etc. Heat can be produced, for example, by the Sun, fire, friction, or from chemical reactions, such as the warmth created by activating a packaged heat wrap.</p>

                                <p>Students can compare and contrast the various forms of energy. Several similarities exist, in that all energy forms have the following in common: 1) the ability to cause change or do work, 2) the dependence that all living things have on energy in order to survive, and 3) the large number of devices humans have invented that use each form of energy. However, forms of energy do vary in their source and their function. Different forms of energy occur naturally, such as the light and heat that come from the Sun or from a fire (heat energy) started by lightning; or flowing water and animals that make sound (sound energy) and move (mechanical energy). Other forms of energy are human-made, such as a toaster (heat energy), radio (sound energy), light bulb (light energy), a car (mechanical energy), or an extension cord (electrical energy). The biggest difference among forms of energy occurs in the infinite number of ways humans use both natural forms of energy and man-made energy devices to live, work, and play on this planet.</p>

                                <p>For example, all devices that are plugged into a socket with a cord or use a battery are powered by electrical energy, yet the object may convert that electrical energy into a number of other energy forms, such as a light bulb (light and heat energy), radio (sound energy), television (sound and light energy), pop-up toaster (heat and mechanical energy), or fan (mechanical energy).</p>
