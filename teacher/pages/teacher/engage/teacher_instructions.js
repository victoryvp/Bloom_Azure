							<li>Have students fill a stemmed glass halfway with water.</li>
							<li>Instruct students to wet their index or middle fingers, and rub their damp fingers around the rim of the glass.</li>
							<li>Encourage students to share their observations. What do they see/hear/feel?</li>
							<li>Lead students to understanding with the following questions:</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Why do you think a sound was produced when the glass was rubbed?</li>
								<li>Is there a way to make the pitch of the sound higher? Lower?</li>
								<li>What other objects do you see in the room that will produce sound?</li>
								<li>Are vibrations always present when we hear a sound? (Yes)</li>
							</ul>
							<li>Allow students to experiment in trying to make different sounds with the glasses. What happens to the sound when they:</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Add more water to the glass?</li>
								<li>Remove water from the glass?</li>
								<li>Rub the glass faster?</li>
								<li>Rub the glass slower?</li>

							<h6>Sentence STEMs</h6>
							<p>For beginner and intermediate ELLs, have the materials translated to their native language as a reference for them to use during the activity. Prior to the students completing the activity on forms of energy, verbally say the words and have the students repeat the words.</p>

							<p>Students can answer these sentence stems with their neighbor and share their answer to review the types of energy they discover in the activity. They may also write these in their journal as a reference. This activity should be used as a review or clarification not to teach the types of energy.</p>

							<h6>Beginner</h6>
							<p>Write the words mechanical, electrical, sound, light, and heat/thermal on the board so the students are spelling the words correctly. Have the students repeat the words so they can practice verbally.</p>

							<p>The glass with water made __________ (type of energy).</p>
							<p>The glass with water also made __________ (type of energy) as another type of energy.</p>
							<p>When I __________ (action used to make energy), __________ made __________ (type of energy).</p>

							<h6>Intermediate</h6>
							<p>The glass with water made__________ (type of energy) when __________ .</p>
							<p>The glass with water also made __________ (type of energy) as another type of energy when __________ .</p>
							<p>When I __________ (action used to make energy), it made __________ (type of energy) because __________ .</p>

							<h6>Advanced/Advanced High</h6>
							<p>One of these should be completed for each type of energy that is used in the demonstration.</p>

							<p>I discovered __________ (type of energy) from the glass of water because __________ .</p>
