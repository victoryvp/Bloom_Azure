						<h6>The Verbs: What should students be doing?</h6>
						<ul>
						<li>Differentiate: to make a distinction; to show what is different.</li>
						<li>Observe: to regard with attention, especially to see or learn something with the senses.</li>
						</ul>
						
						<h6>The Nouns: What concrete words should students know?</h6>
						
						<ul>
						<li>Energy: What is needed to do work or cause change</li>
						<li>Mechanical energy:Energy produced by a machine or moving part</li>
						<li>Sound energy: energy that travels as waves through the air or water and vibrates the ear drum upon contact</li>
						<li>Electrical energy: energy resulting from the flow of charged particles</li>
						<li>Light energy:energy that can be sensed by the eye</li>
						<li>Heat/Thermal energy: Energy that causes a change in temperature between materials</li>
						<li>Transform: to change from one type of thing into another</li>
						</ul>
						
						<h6>Implications for Instruction and Student Misconceptions</h6>
						<ul>
						<li>Students should be given opportunities to describe and observe differences between common forms of energy.</li>
						<li>Students should understand that forms of energy can be transformed into other forms such as using electrical energy to produce light energy.</li>
						<li>Students might think that energy is created when objects are turned on. Remind students energy always exists but often transforms from one form to another.</li>
