Tyler&#x27;s snack requires heat energy to cook the food. Christina uses light energy and electrical energy to see and run her computer game. She can hear Shannon playing the piano because of sound energy. We use all five forms of energy for almost everything we do.</p><p>What type of energy is demonstated in each of these photos?</p><div class="popupimg"><img src="images/enc1.png"/></div><h6>Answer</h6><p>Energy type: Sound energy</p><div class="popupimg"><img src="images/enc2.png"/></div><h6>Answer</h6><p>Energy type: Heat energy</p><div class="popupimg"><img src="images/enc3.png"/></div><h6>Answer</h6><p>Energy type: Mechanical energy</p><div class="popupimg"><img src="images/enc4.png"/></div><br/><h6>Answer</h6><p>Energy type: Electrical energy</p><p><b>What are different forms of energy?</b></p><p>Are you full of energy? Actually you are, even if you&#x27;re sleeping. Energy is keeping your body warm. It takes energy to close your eyes and yawn. We are surrounded by energy— in the air, under our feet, in our bodies. We use it every day in all of its forms. Energy is the ability to do work. It is the power to cause change. Let&#x27;s explore some of the different forms of energy.</p><ul><li><b>Mechanical Energy:</b> Anything that moves is using mechanical energy. When you play soccer, you are using mechanical energy to kick the ball. Cats use mechanical energy to stretch, and ants use it to carry away crumbs. Even things that are not alive can generate mechanical energy. A car uses mechanical energy to move people across town.</li></ul></div></div></div><div class="card lessoncard"><div class="row" style="border-bottom:1px solid #f1f1f1"><div class="col-12"><div class="card-header" style="border-bottom:none"><h5>What Do You Think?</h5></div></div></div><div class="card-block"><div class="popuptxt"><p>How are water and air producing mechanical energy in these photos?</p><div class="popupimg"><img src="images/enc5.png"/></div><br/><h6>Answer</h6><p>The air is moving the kite across the sky and the water is removing the soap from the child’s hands.</p><p><b>Heat and Thermal Energy:</b> When your heart is racing and your body is sweating, you know that you are using energy. The heat that your body gives off by sweating is also energy. We know this because everything is made up of tiny particles. These particles are always moving. Even in a frozen solid like ice, the particles are moving very slowly. The total energy of these moving particles is called thermal energy. Heat is a form of energy that causes these particles to move faster. Think about adding heat to a pot of water on the stove. It gets hotter, right? This means that its temperature increases.</p></div></div></div><div class="card lessoncard"><div class="row" style="border-bottom:1px solid #f1f1f1"><div class="col-12"><div class="card-header" style="border-bottom:none"><h5>Look Out!</h5></div></div></div><div class="card-block"><div class="popuptxt"><p>Just because an object heats up does not mean the object will stay hot. Notice how bath water starts to cool as you sit in it. The water is hot because its particles are moving very quickly. It has a lot of thermal energy. However, the air particles over the water absorb the water&#x27;s heat. Over time, the water particles slow down, and the bath water cools.</p><ul><li><b>Light Energy:</b> The Sun keeps us warm. It also provides another type of energy that we use every day—light energy. Light travels in a straight line from the point where it starts. It can pass through a clear piece of glass or plastic. However, if it hits a solid object that you cannot see through, it will be absorbed.</li></ul><p>Shadows are created when light is stopped from going farther. Some objects will reflect light. This means the light will bounce back to whomever is looking at it. You can see yourself in a mirror because it reflects light. Light energy comes from a few natural sources besides the Sun, such as fire and lightning.</p></div></div></div><div class="card lessoncard"><div class="row" style="border-bottom:1px solid #f1f1f1"><div class="col-12"><div class="card-header" style="border-bottom:none"><h5>Try Now</h5></div></div></div><div class="card-block"><div class="popuptxt"><p>Here is a fun way to see what happens when an object blocks light.</p><ol><li>Choose a partner.</li><li>Each of you can choose four different small objects around the classroom. Do not show these objects to your partner.</li><li>Close all the curtains.</li><li>Turn off the light.</li><li>Take turns holding up one of your objects and shining a flashlight on it.</li><li>Take turns guessing the objects ONLY from the shadows they cast on the wall.</li><li>Describe the shadow.</li><li>Look at the actual object. Were you right?</li><li>Try forming images in front of the flashlight using your fingers. You can create a whole story using finger puppets.</li></ol><div class="popupimg"><img src="images/enc7.png"/></div><br/><p><b>Sound Energy:</b> Sound is another type of energy we use every day. Like light, sound travels in waves. Unlike light, sound can be created by many kinds of objects. When an object vibrates, it moves nearby particles of air back and forth. These particles cause other particles to vibrate. In this way, sound waves travel through the air. If sound waves reach our ears, our brain can translate them into sound because there are small bones in our ears that vibrate. Sound requires a substance to move through, such as air or liquid. That&#x27;s why sounds cannot be heard in empty space. There aren&#x27;t enough particles there!</p><p><b>Electrical Energy:</b> People can create both sound and light energy using another kind of energy called electrical energy. Remember that everything is made up of particles. Some of these particles have electrical charges. When charged particles flow along a path, they form a circuit as electrical energy. Another term for electrical energy is electricity.</p><div class="popupimg"><img src="images/enc8.png"/></div><br/><p><b>How are forms of energy similar and different?</b></p><p>Scientists are able to learn about many things by observing them. We can observe some forms of energy such as light. Other forms of energy are more difficult to observe. However, scientists can still learn about these forms by observing their causes and effects. We have reviewed five forms of energy that affect us every day. They are mechanical, light, heat, sound, and electrical energy. What do these forms of energy have in common?</p><p>Each form of energy causes change or does work. For example, what happens when we put a pan of cake batter into a hot oven? Heat energy in the oven causes the particles in the batter to vibrate faster. As the temperature in the oven rises, the batter changes to a cake.</p><p>How else are these forms of energy similar? Living creatures rely on them to survive. For example, plants cannot grow without light. Plants use the energy in sunlight to make their food. People cannot survive without plants. We eat plants every day. We also feed plants to animals that help us do work or provide us with food.</p><p><b>Everyday Life: How do everyday objects produce or use energy?</b></p><p>You experience heat and thermal energy every day. Coats, scarves, and gloves keep your body warm. The furnace heats your home in the winter. The washing machine uses hot water to wash clothes. You also use hot water to take baths and showers. Your body, the air, and the water all have thermal energy.</p><div class="popupimg"><img src="images/enc9.png"/></div><br/><p>Every movement we make needs mechanical energy. But we have also created tools and machines that help us use mechanical energy more efficiently, or better than we could before. Hoes, spades, and shovels help us move dirt in our own gardens. Farmers rely on huge machines such as tractors and combines to grow acres of food. They are still using mechanical energy. Cars and trains also use mechanical energy to move people quickly from one place to another.</p><p>Sound energy is our main way to communicate. We have invented many machines to help us communicate. Telephones allow people to talk over long distances. Loudspeakers broadcast our messages so people far away can hear them. Earphones let us hear music without bothering people around us. We use sounds such as sirens and whistles as warnings.</p><p>Flashing lights on a police car can be a warning. Light energy is important in our everyday activities. We must be able to see to do most of our work. So, light is now built into many of our machines. Controls in stereos, microwaves, and MP3 players all appear in light. Light bulbs allow us to make night as bright as day. Our homes have light in every room.</p><div class="popupimg"><img src="images/enc10.png"/></div><br/><p>Most of our machines use a few different types of energy to work. Electrical energy often supplies the power to produce other kinds of energy. For example, light bulbs require electrical energy to produce light energy and a small amount of heat energy. Toasters require electrical energy to produce heat energy and a small amount of light energy. Electrical energy powers a fan, creating mechanical energy that keeps us cool.</p><p>Television is a perfect example of an invention that involves all forms of energy. It runs on electricity, which lights up a screen. The images on the screen produce sound energy. Mechanical energy is necessary to operate the controls. Also, a television produces a small amount of heat energy while operating. Can you think of other things in your home that might use many different forms of energy?</p><p><b>What Do You Know?</b></p><p>Machines help us with work we do every day.
